=====================
### Project 1: Udacity Ball chasing robot
#### Description
This project involves creating a robot that can chase a ball autonomously. The robot will be equipped with
a camera, a LiDAR sensor, and a computer vision system. The computer vision system will detect the
ball and send the coordinates to the motor controller, which will then move the robot to chase the ball

### Project 2: Localize and Navigate robot
#### Description
This project involves creating a robot that can navigate through a known map of home world and localize itself. The robot will have Adaptive Monte Carlo localization package to locate itselt in a known map. With the help of gmapping-ROS package it can autonomously navigate itself in a known map when given a 2D point.

### Project 3: Robot Mapping and Map Creation
#### Description
This project involves creating a robot that can map its environment and create a map of the space. The
robot will use the R-TAB ROS package to create a 3D map of the space and the ros-teleop package through which we can move the robot
around in the map.
